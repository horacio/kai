# Philosophy

Time management system, inspired by the `Pomodoro` technique. 

`Kai`'s design is guided by **3** principles:

1. Simple
2. Composeable
3. Flow

## Simplicity

All the components that make up `Kai` are designed to
be as simple as possible, all the commands are short and
easy to remember. The phrases and concepts are intuitive
for their respective contexts. The different components
interact in a natural self-explanotary way.

## Composasability

The tools provided by `Kai` are self-contained and can be
use as stand alone tools and alongside non-`kai` tools. `Kai`
also follows the `UNIX Philosophy` of simple tools that can
be easily piped into each other giving the user the power to
compose self-tailored systems.

## Flow

`Kai` is a tool that you can use while you work, this
means that is should be able to easily intergrate into
your workflow without distracting you, `Kai` is designed
to be embeddable in almost any workflow and to aid in
creating constant flow.

# Core

At it's core `Kai` uses `Git` for storage (Database) and uses
`Markdown` as it's display format.
