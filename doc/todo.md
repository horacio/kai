# Todo File
There are two ways to create a todo list:

1. Todo Init file
2. Interactive wizard

## Todo Init file
The first way is by creating a `.md` file that contains
a description and a list of the tasks of the todo:

```bash
$ kai todo <filename.md>
```

## Interactive wizard
The second way is by using the interactive wizard, you
can do this with the following command:

```bash
$ kai todo <todo name>
```
